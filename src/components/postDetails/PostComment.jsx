          Tucked away in Raipur, this thoughtfully designed multigenerational
          home by Studio Jane Designs is a study in quiet sophistication and
          mindful living. Aptly named Silk Route, the residence is as serene and
          introspective as it is welcomingâ€”a space crafted for both intimate
          reflection and joyful gatherings.
